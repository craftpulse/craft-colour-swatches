/**
 * Server-only plugin that lexes, resolves, rewrites and analyzes url imports.
 *
 * - Imports are resolved to ensure they exist on disk
 *
 * - Lexes HMR accept calls and updates import relationships in the module graph
 *
 * - Bare module imports are resolved (by @rollup-plugin/node-resolve) to
 * absolute file paths, e.g.
 *
 *     ```js
 *     import 'foo'
 *     ```
 *     is rewritten to
 *     ```js
 *     import '/@fs//project/node_modules/foo/dist/foo.js'
 *     ```
 *
 * - CSS imports are appended with `.js` since both the js module and the actual
 * css (referenced via <link>) may go through the transform pipeline:
 *
 *     ```js
 *     import './style.css'
 *     ```
 *     is rewritten to
 *     ```js
 *     import './style.css.js'
 *     ```
